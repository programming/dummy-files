# Dummy Files

This is a collection of dummy files of the more common file types I've generated in different file sizes. They are intended to be use for testing and development purposes.

The files are created with the following command and does not actually contain any real data:

```

```

Please feel free to create a PR if you'd like to add additional file types or file sizes.
